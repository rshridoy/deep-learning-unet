# 🧠 Deep Learning Pipeline with Keras-UNet-Collection

This repository provides a clean, well-documented Jupyter notebook (`update-clean.ipynb`) designed for image dataset preparation and deep learning model training using the [Keras-UNet-Collection](https://github.com/yingkaisha/keras-unet-collection). It is especially useful for tasks such as medical image segmentation, object boundary detection, and other pixel-wise classification problems.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📁 Structured image dataset loading
- 🖼️ Random sample visualization from training data
- 🔧 Integration with `keras-unet-collection` models
- 💡 Easy to adapt for your custom dataset or task
- ⚙️ Can leverage GPU acceleration for training
- 🧼 Clean and modular code for better reproducibility

## 🖼️ Dataset Structure

Ensure your dataset is organized like this:

```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── images/
│   │   ├── img1.png
│   │   └── ...
│   └── masks/
│       ├── img1_mask.png
│       └── ...
├── test/
│   ├── images/
│   └── masks/
```

Each image should have a corresponding mask with the same filename in the `masks/` directory.


## 🛠️ Installation

Install the required packages before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install keras-unet-collection tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

If you're using Google Colab, many of these are already installed. You may still need:

```python
!pip install keras-unet-collection
```


## 📓 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Open the notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter or Colab and open `update-clean.ipynb`.

3. **Upload your dataset**:
   Update dataset paths inside the notebook to point to your local or cloud-stored dataset.

4. **Train your model**:
   Execute the notebook cells to begin training. Modify architecture and hyperparameters as needed.


## ⚡ GPU Support

To enable GPU training:

- Use **Google Colab** (Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU)
- Or set up TensorFlow with CUDA on your local machine


## 📈 Output

- Trained model weights (can be saved manually)
- Training accuracy/loss plots
- Visual comparison of predictions and ground truth masks (optional to add)
